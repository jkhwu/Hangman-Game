# Hangman-Game

I created this game as an exercise in DOM manipulation.

## How to Play

Gameplay is intuitive for those who have played Hangman before. For those who haven't:

- The game randomly chooses a Disney character name that you must guess.
- Try to fill in the blanks with the right letters.
- Start playing by hitting any letter key to guess.
- Non-letter keys will not be accepted by the game.
- You start with 9 guesses left. This number goes down by one each time you guess incorrectly.
- If you get down to 0 guesses left, you lose the round and can try again.
- If you guess all the letters correctly, you win the round.
- The game automatically resets but keeps track of your wins and losses.
- Cheat: open console to view answers.

## Responsiveness
- This game cannot be played on mobile devices yet.
